In view of the above, every student has to learn how to present and manage themselves and their surroundings, apart from learning core and applied subjects. To instill the interest in students to pursue higher education and also to mould them as per the needs of the industry so as to have an edge over the others in the job market, a group of Doctorates from Kakatiya University formed a society named as "SADHANA EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY" and established New Science Degree and PG College in the year 1994. the title "New Science" has been chosen to promote scientific temper among undergraduate students. Since its inception, it has been our endeavor to shape the college into one of the best institutions in Telangana state by inculcating sense of moral values and humanism, without which a degree of any sort will become meaningless.
